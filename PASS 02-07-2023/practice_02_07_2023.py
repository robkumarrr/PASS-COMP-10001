# This is a test document for basic python data types
# the print() statements are used to display the
# variables that we created

# Try some of these yourself after watching the Intro to Python
# Programming videos on MyCanvas

# String
# comprised of characters within " "
str1 = "python string example"
print( str1 )

# Integer
# whole numbers, no decimal points allowed
num = 15
print( str1, num )

# Float
# numbers that can have decimals 
value = 12312415.1019412412312
print( value )

# Boolean
# True or False variables
# This can also be used to determine the truth of certain expressions (think about Boolean Algebra)
chance = True
print( chance )

example2 = 5 < 4 # because 5 is GREATER than 4, this will return as False
print( example2 )
